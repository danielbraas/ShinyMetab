Package: ShinyMetab
Type: Package
Title: ShinyMetab is a package that can do the same computation as MetabFUN, only that it uses a Shiny app to run the functions instead of running code.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel Braas, Ph.D.
Maintainer: Daniel Braas <danielbraas@gmail.com>
Description: The functions were derived from the MetabFUN package with slight modifications to make them more readable and efficient. The shiny app will enable the user to run the 
	functions without the need to write code or call the functions in R.
